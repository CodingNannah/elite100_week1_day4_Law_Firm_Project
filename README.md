# Project Week 1: NZA Law Group Collaboration
START with index.html

## Personal Note:
I, Diana, used Connor's template (html & css) that he created and I forked for the original project we were to design as a team.

## How To:

This is intended to be a group project in which each person should share an equal role in the finished product.

Create a new website for a law firm. This website’s mock design is also included in this file. Use any combination tools we know to complete this assignment: flexbox, grid, bootstrap etc. 

#### GitHub Requirements:
One person from the group (Original Team Member) needs to create the starter files in their Github Profile. 

From there, each person needs to fork & clone the repository and begin working on their portion of the product. 

When each has completed parts of the project, commit them back to github and submit a pull request to the original team member’s repository. 

Each person then needs to submit the original team member’s github link to the Google classroom.

HELPFUL HINT: The original repository holder should create all files and split the work based on the team's agreement. Splitting up the work inside of the CSS and HTML files is recommended!

#### Workflow Management:
Also, to help with workflow management, you may use github's "projects" tab (or start a Trello) to separate and manage what is assigned and has been done. Create 3 boards which are "Work to be done", "In-Progress", and "Completed".

#### Important Notes:
EACH member of the team must commit work. 

Create a README file to show each of your names and what file/code you completed. 

The project is not considered complete until it has been checked in (uploaded) to your GitHub account and the original team member's link posted to the Google Classroom assignment(each person individually).
